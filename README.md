A CPU-based DDS encoder optimized for fast batch conversions with high encoding quality.

### Supported encoding formats

BC7 support is implemented using the [bc7e.ispc](https://github.com/richgel999/bc7enc_rdo) library. As seen in the [Texture Compression in 2020](https://aras-p.info/blog/2020/12/08/Texture-Compression-in-2020/) blog post, this library provides great encoding quality and performance.

Support for BC1 encoding is planned for the future.
